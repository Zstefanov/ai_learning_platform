So the equation would be:\n\n5000 - 10x\n\nCan you give me a hint or tell me what you think the value of x might be? I'm here to help you solve the problem!"

If 500 multiplied by 10 equals 5000, then 500 is actually 10 times a part of 5000, not 10 times less.\n\nTo understand why, think about it like this: if you have 500 apples and you multiply that by 10, then you have 5000 apples. That means the original 500 apples are a part of the total 5000 apples. You're not subtracting 500 from 5000, you're adding the same value to 5000 to get to the total.\n\nSo, to correct the statement: 500 is 10 times a part of 5000, not 10 times less."
