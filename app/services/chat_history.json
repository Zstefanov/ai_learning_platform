For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 by using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, then the number is divisible by 2 and it is printed to the console."

We initialize a variable `x` to 1.\n2. We enter a while loop that continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 10.\n3. Inside the loop, we print the value of `x`.\n4. We increment `x` by 1 using the expression `x += 1`.\n5. The loop repeats until `x` is greater than 10.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."

If the remainder is 0, it means `i` is divisible by 2.\n* If `i` is divisible by 2, we print it to the console using `Console.WriteLine(i)`.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8, which are the only numbers in the range 1 to 10 that are divisible by 2.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a `foreach` loop and a LINQ query to achieve the same result:\n```\nforeach (int i in Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Where(x => x % 2 == 0))\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(i);\n}\n```\nThis is a more concise way to write the loop, but the logic is the same!"
