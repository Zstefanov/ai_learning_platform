For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 by using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, then the number is divisible by 2 and it is printed to the console."

            "content": "Here's an example of how you can use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```\nx = 1\nwhile x <= 10:\n    print(x)\n    x += 1\n```\n\nThis code will print the numbers 1 through 10 to the console.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. We initialize a variable `x` to 1.\n2. We enter a while loop that continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to 10.\n3. Inside the loop, we print the value of `x`.\n4. We increment `x` by 1 using the expression `x += 1`.\n5. The loop repeats until `x` is greater than 10.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
